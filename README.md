# **Awesome DOOM Quickstart for New Gamers**

![](https://pics.spark-in.me/upload/4cf6e7aa0ff44be3713aaff16ce5cef5.jpg)

## **Why?**

There are literally decades worth of forums, mod websites, communities. Recently there also have appeared great "retro" gaming channels (retro is a bit misleading, because some DOOM mods are as good fun as some AAA-titles) on YouTube.

But many people, who have not played DOOM originally, do not know about all this. For example - fun fact - a game that was released in 1993 is still alive and it has one of the most active modding communities ever. I would argue that games like Elder Scrolls, Unreal Tournament or Warcraft (first things that come to mind) also had huge communities, but I would not really say that all of them stood the test of time. People believe that DOOM is something archaic, outdated akin to tetris or pong.

TLDR - DOOM + 20 years of mods = best game ever, still alive. Do not believe me? I played a handful of games in 2019 - DOOM 2016, DOOM megawad Eviternity, a bit of RDR2 - and believe it or not Eviternity was the best game overall in terms of **game experience and design**.

Do not believe me? There is a whole YouTube channel dedicated just to DOOM mods! Obviously it features the most ridiculous ones.

You should also distinguish 4 main types of DOOM games:

- The original "old" releases by ID Software and related media;
- Map packs, WADs (original DOOM assets were in `.wad` file, which were just archives, WAD stands for where's all the data) or MegaWADs - these are usually just new levels or campaigns. Sometimes they feature minor or major asset additions (a few demons, new textures), but the core balance and game-play does not change. These are most cherished by the hardcore DOOMers, because they do not alter the balance of the game. Also the best MegaWADs also have custom soundtracks;
- Weapon packs, power-fantasy mods and randomizer mods (yes, Brutal DOOM and Project Brutality combine all of these concepts);
- Total game conversion mods. So this is not DOOM anymore, it is just another game. It may be cool AF (e.g. Project Brutality or Brutal DOOM) - but the gameplay is vastly different;

I personally like the first and the second type of games most.

So, why DOOM is great after these years? There are a lot of misconceptions on this topic:

- It was NOT a first first person shooting game;
- It was NOT a first 3D game (it was not 3D at all);
- It was NOT a first commercially successful video game;

The real reason is that it was the first game to do all the things right. Also - openness to modding. As for me personally, its endless replayability comes from a few game mechanics:

- Awesome metal-inspired music (best community WADs also have stellar music). Later semi-professional; / indie mods have various music inspirations - from arcade games to techno and bossa nova;
- Initially DOOM was quite open to modification, map-making and tinkering;
- At the beginning of each level all the demons are "asleep". You wake them up either by making sounds or running if front of them and they start chasing you. This sound simple ... but each level replay becomes its unique game. All demons have different speed, size and sometimes can open doors. Also sometimes map designers prohibit demons from entering certain areas. Also there are some subtle hacks, like Archvile jumps or map requiring player to squish demons, use barrels, etc etc;
- Maps are essentially flat in DOOM. It looks 3D, but in reality it is not. Therefore pathfinding is relatively simple for demons and they can chase you. Each game is unique;
- Demons hate each other, and they just need a to be cleverly triggered to in-fight. Needless to say - this makes the game 10x more diverse (there are even maps that are very hard to beat without this mechanic). This is especially relevant in very hard MegaWADs like Sunlust;
 
## **In What Order Should I Play DOOM Games?**

### **"Canon" and Original Games**

This is very brief, go to wiki or something if you need exact historic details.

I suppose to really experience DOOM, you need to play the original games in this order:

- (0) DOOM Shareware (1993-ish) - first episode done mostly by John Romero (included in Final DOOM);
- (1) Full 3 episodes of DOOM (1993-ish) - first commercial relese (included in Final DOOM);
- (2) DOOM II (1994-ish) - 32 levels, arguably the best original game, a bit boring last portion of levels, yes with super shoutgun;
- (3) Ultimate DOOM (1995-ish) - 3 episodes + 1 new episode with a difficulty spike (Thy Flesh Consumed) and 3-4 nice maps;
- (4) E1M8b by John Romero (2016). A replacement for E1M8, which sucked due to being an ending to a shareware release. Play immediately after you beat E1M8 and see for yourself. It even won a Cacoward!;
- (4) Sigil (2019) - 5th canon episode done by Romero. 2 awesome soundtracks (one by Buckethead). Blows the original 3-4 DOOM episodes out of the water, but was met with no universal acclaim mostly because it used only DOOM assets and decades of mods kind of raised the bar. Just consider it a 5th episode;
- (4) Master Levels for Doom II - 20 + 1 (secret) levels for DOOM II. Tough as nails compared to original games;
- (5) Final DOOM (1996-ish) - 32 + 32 levels - TNT: Evilution от Team TNT и The Plutonia Experiment. Made by modders, released by ID;

In my opinion

### **What to Play Next?**

Well you can just go here - https://www.doomworld.com/cacowards/
Or maybe go to Google / YouTube and just find some awesome mods.

Note that Cacowards strive to be fair, i.e. the best award can be given to a whopping MegaWAD, one map or even to a total conversion mod. This is cools, but in my opinion there are some community made DOOM games that are more equal than others:

- Eviternity (2019) - one of the best PC games I have ever played, period. Vastly better than original games, stunning visuals, novel gameplay, etc;
- Sunlust (2015) - one of the hardest and most beautiful MegaWADs out there. Equally evil / punishing as well as visually stunning;
- Back To Saturn X Episode 1 (2012) and Episode 2 (2014). Technically impressive and detailed, though a bit on the boring side;
- Hell Revealed II (2004)

## **Proper Way to Enjoy Modern DOOM**

TLDR - there is [GZDoom](https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom), which is the default go-to option to play more modern [mods](https://zdoom.org/spotlight). But if your jump on these games right on, or even if you try something like Brutal DOOM or Project Brutality from the get go, you most likely will spoit your taste. These games are awesome, but they are not DOOM.

Purists may argue until they bleed from their assholes which [vanilla mod is better](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Comparison_of_Doom_source_ports), but I like PrBoom+ for several plain reasons:

- It is cross-platform;
- It is relatively fresh - latest build 2.5.2 was released in 2017;
- It is very stable, smooth and it can handle maps with thousands of enemies;
- It can be launched via CLI, and what is even more important - using power shell in Windows (or a WLS) - you can launch it using the same commands on PC / Mac / Linux! Isn't this great?
- It has nice docs in the `usage.txt` file'

If you want to be nerdy about your source port, there are videos on the topic:
